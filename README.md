# Endless Depth Plugin for Endless Sky
As of now, this plugin is absolutely not playable. I have big plans and, motivation permitting, will be updating this plugin sporadically as I make progress. I have fresh ideas, and a huge to-do list to get through. The first release of this mod will have minimal story, just a collection of new content to play with. After that I will start work on the storyline for the aliens, which may be short. We'll see.

I have carried over a lot of the content from the previous iteration of this plugin, but it is just temporary. I will be updating everything as I work through it. Currently, the rough timeline is as follows:

1. Finish the Scavengers. This is where I'm going to figure out what I want the scavenging feature of this plugin to look like. I have some rough ideas, but I need to find a satisfactory way to implement this before I go making a whole galaxy based around this! This will be the first playable release.
2. Complete the map for the Triangulum galaxy, and make a link between it and the Milky Way via Jumpgate. There will be a mission involving the Scavenger faction to activate the Jumpgate, however the galaxy will still be void of ships at this time.
3. Complete each factions's ships, outfits, fleets, jobs. Add that scavenging flavor. Maybe a bit of.. crafting? This one will be a doozy. Second playable release.
4. Story of indeterminate length. Third release will likely be when this is complete, or cut midway like the Wanderer campaign.

## Content List:

### What's Done

- Nothing! Although I have a some of basics done, nothing has been finished yet.

### What's Coming

- Human Scavengers: This is a pirate-related faction I plan on implementing first. They are really more of a neutral party, but they have no quarrels with selling to pirates or civilians. The only people who really dislike them are the Syndicate, who view their operations as theft. This faction is mostly to introduce scavenging to the player before it's used as a major element of the alien faction. Scavengers will operate out of mostly Southern/Dirt Belt planets, as well as Pirate planets and give jobs/missions to the player for scavenging specific items.
- Triangulum Galaxy v2: More on this later, although you can already see some of what's planned in the data files. Aliens!
- Maybe a few other things. Although I my main focus is the new factions, I have a few other ideas (such as convoy raiding missions) that I want to try out.
