# general scrap metal minables which will drop mostly junk, occasionally a broken outfit (something general that ships from any region have)
# surviving payload is calculated as a binomial distribution, with n = payload value, and p = 0.25
# it can be visualized with this: https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~mbognar/applets/bin.html
# I've included the estimated value for each minable to make sure they aren't crazily unbalanced. Numbers are not final.

# Not every ship will be used in salvage jobs, only the more common ships.
# The hull value for each minable should be the somewhere below the disabled value for each ship, which is determined with "maximumHull * max(.15, min(.45, 10. / sqrt(maximumHull)))"
