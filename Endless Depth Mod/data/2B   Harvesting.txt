# general scrap metal minables which will drop mostly junk, occasionally a broken outfit (something general that ships from any region have)
# surviving payload is calculated as a binomial distribution, with n = payload value, and p = 0.25
# it can be visualized with this: https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~mbognar/applets/bin.html
# I've included the estimated value for each minable to make sure they aren't crazily unbalanced. Numbers are not final.

	description "These parts are vital to engine function, but as they are relatively cheap to make they aren't usually worth buying as salvage. Most people will likely only take them to be melted down."

# These minables will only be small ships however, interceptors, small transports, light freighters. Larger things will be added as salvage jobs. 
# Not every ship will be used in salvage jobs, only the more common ships.
# The hull value for each minable should be the disabled value for each ship, which is determined with "maximumHull * max(.15, min(.45, 10. / sqrt(maximumHull)))"
# Since each minable can only produce one payload, I may make multiple minables per ship with different drops.
