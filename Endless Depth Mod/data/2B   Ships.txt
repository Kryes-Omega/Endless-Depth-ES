# Variants need to be made for freighters to be used in the Convoy fleets so that they can't be captured so easily. It's an important cargo convoy, why wouldn't they be expecting pirates?
# For the Boarding Defense variants, I've put one Security Station per min. crew, plus enough laser rifles for half of the remaining bunks.
# Since NPCs spawn with a random amount of crew above the minimum, I think its good to have spares in the armory.

# Below here I'm going to be putting Scavenger variants of ships. They will definitely have more boarding capability than regular pirates (not sure why they aren't but I'm not messing with them for now) and may even use nerve gas.
# I'm not sure whether I will need to make new loadouts for the ships, but seeing as beam weapons are the prime choice for capping and mining, they will definitely be equipped with those primarily.

# I will also be utilizing variants for the larger salvage ships (for use in the salvage jobs) rather than making new ships entirely. 
# Some will be usable. They will have a new damaged looking ship image, permanent hull damage and lowered value (before depreciation), and some damaged outfits (Damaged Hyperdrive, Engines) which will need to be replaced in order to use the ship. If the system you're in doesn't have an outfitter, you're out of luck.
# Some will be completely wrecked and unusable. They will be identical stat-wise to their usable variants except the value will be even lower and they will have zero outfit space to prevent replacement of damaged outfits.
