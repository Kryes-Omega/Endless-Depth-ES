	description "The fuel tanker is basically a flying gas station. The stock Jump Tanker holds enough fuel for 8 normal jumps, and has more ramscoop than any human device. It is used by long-distance fleets of all types throughout the galaxy, saving outfitting and cargo space for more useful items such as defensive items or trade goods, and is very cost effective in the long run."
	description "	The one shortcoming of the Jump Tanker is its very poor defence. The tanker, no matter how useful, is still that, a tanker. In order to fly smoothly, armor was sacrificed in favor of speed and shields, and thus is much more dangerous when it explodes, and much weaker in general. It is advised to have a good amount of defence on other ships to protect the tanker, or for it to be held back until either the need arises or just a system behind. If all else fails, it is highly advised that you promptly, get your hull the hell out of there."

	description "The Consignare was an attempt to modernize the ageing Bactrian city-ship, in that it was more like a Heavy Warship/Freighter cross breed, with no real place than most normal ships. This time however, the ship was much more automated, and didn't require anywhere near as high a crew count. It was safe to say, the ship was a hit among trade barons, just like the Bactrian. The Consignare is used as escorts for the cheaper but less armed freighters such as the Behemoth and Bulk Frieghter."

	description `The Garrison Missile is a large missile that delivers a high damage explosion on impact. Unfortunately, it is rather expensive to use in regular patrols, and too awkward to store for later, so the Republic politely declined the military contract with the producer. The Garrison Missile is bought mainly because it is the only non-illegal substitute for a nuclear warhead, as well as the bonus of being more intelligent, and can be used just as normal drones can, only they are one time use.`
